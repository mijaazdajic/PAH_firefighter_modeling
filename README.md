Dynamic modeling of firefighter exposure to PAHs


This is the Python code used to model the dermal absorption of naphthalene in firefighters



# ABSTRACT

#  
  Firefighters experience increased risk of cancer and other serious illnesses. Exposures to chemicals found in combustion emissions are thought to be contributing to these rates. We developed a model to investigate firefighters’ dermal exposures using one of the compounds found in combustion emissions, naphthalene. Time of decontamination and body location of contamination were found to notably influence the amount of naphthalene entering the body. Interestingly, if decontamination of skin happened after a long delay (~600 minutes), the timing of decontamination no longer influenced naphthalene absorbance. For location on the body, the inner forearm absorbed naphthalene most readily followed by the temple, back of the hand, and outer forearm. This model shows potential for use in assessment of firefighters’ exposures and effectiveness of exposure reduction procedures.
